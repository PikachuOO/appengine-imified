Providing an Instant Messaging interface to your App Engine application is easier than you might think. And you don't have to wait for the upcoming XMPP API or ignore those using other networks.

IMIfied provide a currently free service which provides a web hook like interface to an instant messaging bot. In order to experiment with this you'll need to sign up for a free account at "IMified":http://imified.com.

You should be able to see a live example of this at "xmpp-imified.appspot.com":http://imified.appspot.com
